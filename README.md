### Selected Technologies
The selected technologies or my individual project will be the Angular stack, combined with the web3js Ethereum API.
I will also be using the Metamask wallet.

### Main Objectives
The main objectives of mine for the project are: Provide the neccesary wireframes, which are well designed, and make them into HTML/Angular views, connecting the frontend do the backend, providing login via Metamask, Different views for different users, coherent UI design

### List of tasks
 - Providing the wireframes (to make a coherent design o the website that is readable and functional before tackling the programming)
 - Connecting the wallet (to make logging in easier and making it possible to enact transactions)
 - Login via Wallet (to make it easier to log in)
 - Registering profile (via wallet, basic data sent to the DB)
 - User profile (so the user can see his bought / accepted / reviewed articles)
 - Review dashboard (so the users can leave reviews of articles and make the article reputation work)
 - Paper view (probably download, as PDFs can usually be opened in browser)
 - Editor dashboard (So editors can do their tasks - reviewing papers, deleting papers,...)
 - Author dashboard (so the author can see how well their article is doing)
 - Reader dashboard (Filtering search, keyword search, last 10 articles, ...)
